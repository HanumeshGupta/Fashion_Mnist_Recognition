## 🌟 Overview

This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** to classify images of clothing items into **10 different categories**, helping machines understand fashion trends! 👗🤖

### 🛠️ Features

✅ **CNN Model** for accurate classification.\
✅ **Trained on Fashion MNIST Dataset** – 60,000 training images & 10,000 test images.\
✅ **Pretrained Model (****`Fashion_MNIST_model.h5`****)** for quick inference.\
✅ **Interactive Web App (****`web.py`****)** built using **Flask/Streamlit**.\
✅ **Image Upload Feature** – Classify custom images like `Pullover.jpg` and `Bag.webp`.

---

## 🏷️ Dataset

- Fashion MNIST contains **grayscale 28x28 pixel images** of clothing items.
- **Categories:** 👕 T-shirt/Top, 👖 Trousers, 👗 Dress, 🧥 Coat, 👟 Sneaker, 🎒 Bag, etc.
